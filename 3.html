<h3>JavaScript란 무엇인가</h3>
<p>
    JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language 
    that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, 
    prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. 
    It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, 
    and imperative programming styles. It has application programming 
    interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, 
    standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
    
    The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), 
    such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, 
    the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.

    Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective 
    standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly 
    in design.
